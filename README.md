# 🚀 React Router Tutorial

An interactive and beginner-friendly React project that demonstrates the core concepts of **React Router** with clean layouts using **Tailwind CSS** and **DaisyUI**. This tutorial-style project focuses on dynamic routing, navigation hooks, context sharing, and form handling with both controlled and uncontrolled components.

---

## 📘 Description

This project is designed to help new and intermediate React developers master **React Router** in a real-world environment. With a clear folder structure, educational comments, and animated UI components, this app provides practical experience building multipage applications — just like in production.

You'll navigate between users, load API data with loaders, handle dynamic parameters, display user-friendly 404 errors, and share data with the Context API — all wrapped in a beautifully responsive layout styled with **Tailwind CSS** and **DaisyUI**.
